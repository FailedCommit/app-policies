    <h1>Data Deletion Policy &amp; Account Deletion Instructions for Apprec8</h1>

    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 01, 2025</p>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> June 01, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>This document outlines the policy and instructions for requesting the deletion of your account and associated personal data (your email address) from the <em>Apprec8</em> mobile application ("App"), provided by Apprec8 ("we," "us," or "our").</p>
    <p>We are committed to respecting your data privacy rights, including your right to request the deletion of your personal information.</p>

    <h2>2. What Personal Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>As described in our Privacy Policy, the only personally identifiable information we collect from you is your <strong>email address</strong>, which is used for the purpose of creating and managing your account, ensuring account uniqueness, and facilitating login.</p>

    <h2>3. How to Request Account and Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>You have the right to request the deletion of your account and the associated email address. You can do this through the following methods:</p>

    <p><strong>A. In-App Deletion Request:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Open the Apprec8 App on your device.</li>
        <li>Navigate to the <strong>Profile</strong> &gt; <strong>Settings &amp; Support</strong> &gt; <strong>Delete My Account</strong> section within the App.</li>
        <li>Follow the prompts to request account deletion.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>B. Web URL / Email Deletion Request:</strong></p>
    <p>If you are unable to access the App or prefer to make a request via other means, you can request account and data deletion by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sending an email to: <strong>mohitchilkoti@gmail.com</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please include the following information in your email request:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The subject line: "Account Deletion Request"</li>
        <li>The email address associated with the account you wish to delete.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We may need to verify your identity before processing your deletion request to protect your information.</p>

    <h2>4. Process of Deletion</h2>
    <p>Upon receiving your deletion request through one of the methods described above:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Verification:</strong> We may take reasonable steps to verify that the request is legitimate and that you are the owner of the account in question (e.g., by sending a confirmation link to the registered email address).</li>
        <li><strong>Processing Time:</strong> We will process your request in accordance with applicable laws (such as the DPDPA in India). We aim to complete the deletion process within 90 days of verifying the request.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>5. What Data is Deleted</h2>
    <p>When your account deletion request is processed, the following will be permanently deleted from our active databases:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your user account in the Apprec8 App.</li>
        <li>The email address associated with your account.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As we only collect your email address for account functionality, this means all personally identifiable information we store about you will be deleted.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention (Post-Deletion)</h2>
    <p>Our standard practice is to permanently delete your email address from our operational systems upon a verified deletion request.</p>
    <p>We will not retain your email address once your account is deleted, except in very limited circumstances where required by applicable law or for legitimate and limited purposes such as maintaining a record of the deletion request itself for compliance, or if necessary for security or fraud prevention for a limited, legally permissible period. Any such retained data will not be used for any other purpose.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update these Data Deletion Instructions from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal obligations. Any changes will be posted on this page, and the "Last Updated" date will be revised.</p>
